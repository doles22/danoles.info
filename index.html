                        <p>
                            Becoming an insight driven organization starts with the foundational building blocks of making data accurate, available, and discoverable. My team and I were tasked with building a cloud based data platform to support the organizations
                            needs for reporting. We build an entirely new platform, socialized new analytics products, and reviewed many partners throughout this process. <a href="https://danoles.info/">Learn more</a>

                      <p>
                          Access Manager was a custom built user management system to enable our external customers to login seamlessly across our applications.
                          There was quite a learning curve to be able to manage this product well. The demo's you see in the videos are the intial MVP builds of Access Manager and this shows what we launched to our internal employees for managing our vendors and customers.
                          After the initial build we had to look intensly at the internal staffing and what our options were. We decided that we should purchase rather than build the final product. 
                          This was a massive learning experience for myself and the organization. This experience gave me a passion for the details when it comes to user management. It is the backbone of a great customer experience!

                 </div>
                      <p>
                          Gordon Now was a think tank idea come to life. Through ideation and research we took app design wireframes and made the real.
                          Our team built a suite of digital assistant products accross chatbot, voice, and app to help our customers work with us. 
                          We did immense research in what would be the most useful functionality for the users and built a roadmap to progress this portfolio of products into a commonly used service for our customers.
                          The app alone has ~26k active uesrs and is continually progressed by the current product team. In the folder you will see some screen shots of what the app looked like as well as some of the prompts the voice assistant could handle in their initial phases.
                          There is also a customer testimonial video for added sweetness!
