                    Thanks for taking the time to explore. Below is a brief portfolio including some of the products I have worked on over the years.
                    It isn't comprehensive, but its gives you a few highlights.<br><br>

                   <h2>Access Manager</h2>
                 </div>
                      <p>Access Manager was a custom built user management system to enable our external customers to login seamlessly across our applications.
                      There was quite a learning curve to be able to manage this product well. The demo's you see in the videos are the intial MVP builds of Access Manager and this shows what we launched to our internal employees for managing our vendors and customers.
                      After the initial build we had to look intensly at the internal staffing and what our options were. We decided that we should purchase rather than build the final product. 
                      This was a massive learning experience for myself and the organization. This experience gave me a passion for the details when it comes to user management. It is the backbone of a great customer experience! 
                  </p>
                
                <div id="product_name">
                   <h2>Gordon Now</h2>
                 </div>
                      <p>Gordon Now was a think tank idea come to life. Through ideation and research we took app design wireframes and made the real.
                          Our team built a suite of digital assistant products accross chatbot, voice, and app to help our customers work with us. 
                          We did immense research in what would be the most useful functionality for the users and built a roadmap to progress this portfolio of products into a commonly used service for our customers.
                          The app alone has ~26k active uesrs and is continually progressed by the current product team. In the folder you will see some screen shots of what the app looked like as well as some of the prompts the voice assistant could handle in their initial phases.
                          There is also a customer testimonial video for added sweetness!

                   <h2>IDO Portfolio</h2>
                 </div>
                      <p>IDO (Insight Driven Organization) was a new department when I joined as the product owner. The team has since grown given the massive scope we have to take on. I have been able to build the product practice from the ground up here. 
                          Our area was tasked with the immense goal of brining our organization in a nimble and new cloud based data platform. This included new build, launching, and socializing to all our internal stakeholders. 
                          If that wasn't enough we did all of this through an ERP transition for both US and Canada. 
                          In this folder you will see some examples and definitions of how we built our product practice to work with other teams. As well as an example of the ~46 individual products that were built on this platform.
