# Dan Oles
I built this site completely custom because I wanted to learn more about CSS, HTML and JS on my own time. Plus it's always a great feeling when I accomplish something and it works well! 


Index.html
holds all html for the home page and defines classes used in the stylesheet.css

Stylesheet.css:
is the global style sheet that applies to all html pages and houses any and all css code for this repository. If there are multiple styles needed add a section at the bottom of this page. 

Media folder:
holds all static images for the site. 
eventually I would like this folder to house an embed document that are referenced and called into different pages. Plus all integrations with feeds for media content.
