# Two Plus More
Enjoy our life and learn from our experiences. Join the Two of us on our journeys and more! 



Index.html
holds all html for the home page and defines classes used in the stylesheet.css

Stylesheet.css:
is the global style sheet that applies to all html pages and houses any and all css code for this repository. If there are multiple styles needed add a section at the bottom of this page. 

Media folder:
holds all static images for the site. 
eventually I would like this folder to house an embed document that are referenced and called into different pages. Plus all integrations with feeds for media content.
